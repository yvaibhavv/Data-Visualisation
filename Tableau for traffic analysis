TASK DESCRIPTION:
The NSW Minister for Transport and the Chief Data Scientist, Dr. Ian Oppermann, are interested in finding out if there is a tendency towards more (or less) risky driving by the state’s motorists over time.  Using the data made available to you, carry out a range of OLAP (and other) analyses to provide a credible, justified, data-driven answer.  Be warned that you cannot simply aggregate over time; you will need to make adjustments for changes in the value of the fines for the same offence, the numbers of cameras, and the number of motorists on NSW roads over time.  If you need to gather additional data, please do so, justify its use and how you used this data in your analysis.  Make sure that your answer is well supported by appropriate and relevant analyses, tables, and other forms of visualisation.
